# Lake Chad Conservation Project Website

Hello and welcome to the repository of the Lake Chad Conservation Project website. I designed this platform to shed light on the pressing conservation needs of Lake Chad, a crucial and vulnerable ecosystem located in Africa. Please visit [the source code](https://github.com/1Funso/Lake-Chad-Project-1) or [the live project](https://1funso.github.io/Lake-Chad-Project-1/)

## Purpose

My goal with this project is to highlight the severe ecological problems Lake Chad is currently experiencing due to climate change and human activities. The website serves as an informative and inspiring hub, offering detailed information about the lake's history, the threats it's presently dealing with, and the ongoing efforts to conserve it. It also shows visitors how they can contribute to this cause.

## Features

- **Stunning Visuals:** This is a robust gallery brimming with images that encapsulate the extraordinary beauty and biodiversity of Lake Chad, thus underlining the significance of conservation.The images used on the website were sourced from collections that offer Common Creative licenses, ensuring there is no risk of copyright infringement.
- **Informative Content:** I've provided rich and engaging content about Lake Chad's history, the challenges it's now facing, and the measures being taken to conserve it.
- **Engagement Opportunities:** The website encourages visitors to get involved and help contribute to the conservation cause, ensuring Lake Chad's preservation for future generations.

## Design

The website employs a clean and professional design, with a substantial focus on visual content. I've used responsive design elements to ensure a consistent user experience on various devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

- **Fonts:** I have chosen the "Arial, sans-serif" font family for its readability and simplicity.
- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3
- **Accessibility Testing** The code implemented on the website includes a passthrough integration with the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools, allowing for comprehensive accessibility evaluation and analysis.
- **Responsiveness** This website has been fully optimized to ensure responsiveness and seamless functionality across a variety of device sizes and platforms. I utilized the Chrome Development Tools to inspect and analyze the website's performance on various devices, including Apple iPhone SE, XR, 12 Pro, Apple iPad, Apple MacBook Air, Samsung Galaxy S8+, s20 Ultra, A51/71, fold, Ultrawide display with 3440x1440 resolution, and classic 16:9 display with 2560x1440 resolution. Through the use of these tools, I was able to evaluate the website's responsiveness and ensure compatibility across different screen sizes.
